 Three missionaries and three cannibals are on the left bank of the river.
 Everyone wants to move to the other shore. There is a small boat that can hold no more than two people.
 If there are more cannibals than missionaries on the shores, they will eat the missionaries.
 If more missionaries are found, they will turn the cannibals into their faith.
 Find a sequence of trips that guarantees the safety of missionaries and the freedom of worship of cannibals.
